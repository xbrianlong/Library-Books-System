# Library-Books-System
Python and MySQL project done in NUS year 1 as part of a Data Management and Visualisation Module (BT2102).

For this project, we worked as a team of 4 and were tasked to make a basic application using Tkinter and connect it to MySQL for our database. We also learnt to create our own conceptual data model and apply it to this project.
Since we do not have sufficient time and exposure to git, our usage for git is very minimal and we merged our progress into 1 branch before touching it up before submission outside of git, hence there is no history for commits and pull requests in this repository.
